## Project Structure

For a detailed explanation of the project organization, see **[STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md)**.

### Quick Overview

```text
src/todo_lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Domain layer (business logic, data structures, events)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # User interface layer (input/output)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/     # Controller layer (orchestration)
```

The application follows a **layered architecture** with three distinct layers:

- **Models**: All business logic, domain types, and events
- **UI**: Terminal I/O, command parsing, and output formatting  
- **Controller**: Orchestrates interactions between UI and models

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Task** (`models/task.rs`)
   - Data structure representing a single todo item
   - Methods: `new()`, `toggle_completion()`, `set_priority()`, `get_priority()`, `is_completed()`, `get_status_symbol()`
   - Includes comprehensive unit tests

2. **TodoList** (`models/todo_list.rs`)
   - Business logic for managing a collection of tasks
   - CRUD operations: add, remove, complete, uncomplete, toggle
   - Task querying: get all tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks, filtered tasks
   - Priority management: set and query task priorities
   - Auto-incrementing task IDs
   - Extensively tested with edge cases

3. **Priority** (`models/priority.rs`)
   - Priority levels: Low (‚ñº), Medium (‚ñ†), High (‚ñ≤)
   - Color-coded terminal output (green/yellow/red)
   - String parsing with multiple aliases

4. **TaskFilter** (`models/task_filter.rs`)
   - Flexible filter builder for querying tasks
   - Filter by status: completed/pending
   - Filter by priority: high/medium/low
   - Combined filters: both status AND priority
   - Fluent builder API

5. **UiEvent** (`models/ui_event.rs`)
   - Event definitions: `AddTask`, `ListTasks`, `RemoveTask`, `CompleteTask`, `SetPriority`, etc.
   - Clean abstraction between UI input and controller actions
   - Domain events representing user intentions

6. **LoopControl** (`models/loop_control.rs`)
   - Control flow enum: `Continue`, `Break`
   - More descriptive than boolean for loop control

7. **InputReader** (`ui/input_reader.rs`)
   - Handles reading user input from stdin
   - Parses user commands into `UiEvent` enums
   - Validates command syntax and arguments
   - Supports command aliases (e.g., "rm", "done", "h")
   - Clean separation of input concerns

8. **OutputWriter** (`ui/output_writer.rs`)
   - Handles all output operations to stdout
   - Colored terminal output using the `colored` crate
   - Semantic display methods for different scenarios
   - Formats task lists with proper styling
   - Separates presentation logic from business logic

9. **TodoController** (`controller/todo_controller.rs`)
   - Event-driven controller that reacts to UI events
   - Coordinates between InputReader, OutputWriter, and TodoList
   - Owns InputReader, OutputWriter, and TodoList
   - Clean handler methods for each event type
   - Main application loop

10. **Main** (`main.rs`)
    - Simple application entry point
    - Creates and runs the TodoController

### Event Flow

```text
User Input ‚Üí InputReader.read_input()
          ‚Üí InputReader.parse_command()
          ‚Üí UiEvent
          ‚Üí TodoController.handle_event()
          ‚Üí TodoList operations
          ‚Üí OutputWriter.show_*() methods 
          ‚Üí Output to user
```

## Installation and Running

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ installed on your system

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the application
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run tests with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run only unit tests
cargo test --lib

# Run only integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

## Usage

When you run the application, you'll see a command prompt where you can enter various commands:

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `add <description>` | Add a new task | `add Buy groceries` |
| `list [filter]` | List tasks (all/completed/pending) | `list`, `list completed`, `list pending` |
| `remove <id>` | Remove a task by ID | `remove 1` |
| `complete <id>` | Mark task as completed | `complete 1` |
| `uncomplete <id>` | Mark task as pending | `uncomplete 1` |
| `toggle <id>` | Toggle task completion status | `toggle 1` |
| `exit` | Exit the program | `exit` |

### Example Session

```text
add Buy groceries
Task added: Buy groceries

add Read a book
Task added: Read a book

list
1. [ ] Buy groceries
2. [ ] Read a book

complete 1
Task marked as complete: Buy groceries

list
1. [x] Buy groceries
2. [ ] Read a book

remove 1
Task removed: Buy groceries

exit
Goodbye!
```

## Testing

- `Task`: Creation, completion toggling, status display
- `TodoList`: CRUD operations, edge cases, ID management
- `InputReader`: Command parsing validation
- `OutputWriter`: Output formatting
- `TodoController`: Event handling, component coordination

### Integration Tests

The `tests/integration_tests.rs` file contains:

- End-to-end workflow tests
- Command parsing and execution
- Multi-step task management scenarios
- Error handling verification

### Documentation Tests

## Design Decisions

### Event-Driven Architecture

- Clean separation between UI input and controller logic
- `UiEvent` enum provides type-safe event handling
- Easy to extend with new commands/events

### Separation of Input and Output

- `InputReader` handles reading and parsing user commands
- `OutputWriter` handles formatting and displaying messages
- Complete independence between input and output concerns
- Each can be tested and modified independently

### Semantic Output Methods

- Instead of generic `print_line()`, OutputWriter has specific methods like `show_task_added()`, `show_task_removed()`
- Better separation of concerns (Controller doesn't know formatting details)
- Easier to maintain and modify output formatting

### DRY Principle

- Task listing methods share a common `show_task_list()` helper
- Eliminates duplication across `show_all_tasks()`, `show_completed_tasks()`, `show_pending_tasks()`

### LoopControl Enum

- More descriptive than boolean for main loop control
- `LoopControl::Continue` and `LoopControl::Exit` are self-documenting
- Easier to extend with additional control flow states if needed

### Controller Owns Components

- `TodoController` owns `InputReader`, `OutputWriter`, and `TodoList` as fields
- Eliminates repetitive parameter passing
- Clearer ownership model and lifecycle management

### Test-Driven Development

- 70 tests covering core functionality, edge cases, and integration scenarios
- Tests serve as living documentation
- High confidence in refactoring and changes
